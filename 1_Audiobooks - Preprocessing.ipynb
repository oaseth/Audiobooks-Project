    "A data from an Audiobook app is given. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database. The goal is to create a machine learning algorithm based on the available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company. But the prior to that, the data has to be preprocessed.\n",

    "The Audiobook data has several columns: Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg (average of all purchases), Book length in minutes_sum (sum of all purchases), Price Paid_avg (average of all purchases), Price paid_sum (sum of all purchases), Review (a Boolean variable), Review (out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).\n",
